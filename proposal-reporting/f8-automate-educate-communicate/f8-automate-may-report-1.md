### Is there anything else you would like to share about your project? \*

We have mostly just been closing off the old proposals and getting everything ready for this new proposal. Once we have closed the old ones we will start creating the environment for this proposal. This includes setting up dework and a list of bounties that people from the community can take. We have been meeting mostly twice a week to work on this. Another thing we've been working on passively is using the project board and trying to identify ways of automating some of the actions we do every week. The idea is to find a way to use the project board a certain way and then automate a bunch of things and possibly create content that can assist in the monthly and close out report.

### Is there anything you would like to communicate to the Funded Proposer of Toolmakers Catalyst Circle reps to discuss in their forum? For example articulating ideas or recommendations for improvements to the Catalyst ecosystem?

Not right now, but definitely in the future
