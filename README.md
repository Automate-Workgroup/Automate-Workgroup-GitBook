### Treasury Guild

Treasury Guild offers a 1 to 1 accounting and treasury service to projects within the Catalyst ecosystem. If you are looking for Treasury Services go [here](https://www.treasuryguild.io/service/). Below you will find our website, Transaction GitBooks and Proposals (need to update proposals page)&#x20;

Treasury Guild offers the creation, organization and management of wallets. Fast transactions 24/7. We document all transactions in Github and display them in a specially created Dashboard for your project. All transactions are stored on the Blockchain. If you want more transaction privacy, we can arrange that too.

If your project needs a platform like Dework, our team does well on the Dework platform. The transactions we do are not conditioned only by single payments, but we also do bulk payments, up to 100 transactions in one payment.

## Why you should work with us

Values - We put transparency first and follow open source principles.

Our approach - Most projects on Catalyst evolve as they execute their deliverables. As these changes happen we also need to adapt and update the treasury project plan. Monthly reports will be generated and presented to the project team to open up any changes to the original plan and agree on the updated plan. Any updates to the monthly payments will be decided based on the monthly report. We will then prepare the information for the upcoming payments in spreadsheets and on the day IOG releases the funds we will make all the agreed upon payments. All transactions we execute carry metadata and are documented for public viewing. We will either share or have sole access to the wallet that holds the funds.

## What we offer

Treasury Guild advisory service will manage budgets & document transactions so that everything is accessible and transparent. We will also provide Project Management support to ease proposal delivery.
