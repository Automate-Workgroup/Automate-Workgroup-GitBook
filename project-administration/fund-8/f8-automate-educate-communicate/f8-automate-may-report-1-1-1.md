### Is there anything else you would like to share about your project? \*

We are dropping bounty system for the following reasons.

We struggled to add items to the bounty wish list. We saw that funded projects need help with treasury and project management In order to design automations we would need to research what is needed in these projects as they are all different from each other. Research can be done by helping funded projects and identifying new automations in the process. Decided to shift our focus to doing this research and create automations where needed. We found that our own resources were sufficient to develop GitHub actions and there was insufficient bounty applications

### Is there anything you would like to communicate to the Funded Proposer of Toolmakers Catalyst Circle reps to discuss in their forum? For example articulating ideas or recommendations for improvements to the Catalyst ecosystem?

Not at this time
