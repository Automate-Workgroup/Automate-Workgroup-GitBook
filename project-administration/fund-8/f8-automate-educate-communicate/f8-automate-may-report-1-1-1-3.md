In the next 6 months

### Please provide details here about the work, tasks, activities you have delivered since last report. The more detail the better - one line is not sufficient \*

We are gathering information from the other projects we are involved in. Every project has a different way of doing project management and reporting. We will use the information we gather to identify new automations. GitHub is also receiving new updates which will enable new kinds of automations. We will look at these new updates as they roll out. Once we identified any possible automations we will put them on the project board.

### Is there anything you would like to communicate to the Funded Proposer of Toolmakers Catalyst Circle reps to discuss in their forum? For example articulating ideas or recommendations for improvements to the Catalyst ecosystem?

Please fix this question - It should be Funded Proposer "OR" Toolmakers .... not "of" .
