### Please provide details here about the work, tasks, activities you have delivered since last report. The more detail the better - one line is not sufficient \*

We are involved and doing research in another project (Governance Services Guild) where we are trying to identify automations that can be done on the project board that also integrates with dework. We have seen opportunities for automations, but more iterations is needed to refine the weekly processes. Once patterns are identified and verified to be consistent, we can dedicate to automating those processes. Whatever we find in this research will be brought over to this project to document and use as inspiration for more possible automations. We also closed a few tasks on the project board this month, mostly admin work, making room for more automation work.
