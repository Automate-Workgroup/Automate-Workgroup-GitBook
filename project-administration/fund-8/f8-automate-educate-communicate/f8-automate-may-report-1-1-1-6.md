### Please provide details here about the work, tasks, activities you have delivered since last report. The more detail the better - one line is not sufficient. The purpose of this question is to show clearly the work you have been doing on the last month - this must be clearly explained \*

We have noticed alot of groups using Dework and tried to integrate our GitHub automations into the Dework process, but realised it's not the best fit as the data isnt always accurate. We then decided to build something specifically for Dework, to assist in monthly reporting. We are building something for Governance Guild. This tool will be Open Source and will assist with monthly reporting as it will take monthly Dework exports and create reports based on the data received every month. This is an experiment and so far the basic scaffolding for the tool has already been put together.

### Is there anything you would like to communicate to the Funded Proposer of Toolmakers Catalyst Circle reps to discuss in their forum? For example articulating ideas or recommendations for improvements to the Catalyst ecosystem?

Nope

### Do you wish to provide your evidence by way of a URL/ link(s) or do you wish to upload your evidence? \*

Link

### If you answered 'Link' to the above question please add the link/s here. Please do check that the link/s work.

### Please provide an explanation of the evidence you are submitting - what does the evidence show? how does it demonstrate your month on month progress? \*

This is the repo of the tool we are developing for Governance Guild. This will be the admin tool for managing all the Dework exports of different projects. It is still being run locally and is not live yet. So far the tool reads the dework export from a Github folder. The folder is in the repo under /src/assets/dework-files/governance-guild. It then organises and sends the data to a database.

### Finally, please list here what work you need to complete in the next 30 days in order to keep the project on track  \*

Next steps will be to do some work on the UI and maybe add Authentication to the tool.
