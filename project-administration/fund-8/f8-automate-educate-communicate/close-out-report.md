## Challenge KPIs and how the project addressed them

The challenge was to grow the open-source ecosystem by improving projects and sharing part of their efforts. KPIs for this challenge included an increase in the number and quality of Cardano Open Source projects, an increase in contributors, and an increase in open source tools and frameworks from the community for the community (dog-fooding). Here's how the project addressed these KPIs:

Increase in the number and quality of Cardano Open Source projects - We developed two Dework-related tools and provided several GitHub Actions that have been useful to the community. This not only increased the number of open-source projects but also improved the quality of projects in the ecosystem.

Increase in contributors - We didn’t manage to onboard new contributors to help develop automations, but the learning material we created will hopefully help educate potential contributors.

Increase in open source tools and frameworks - We produced open source training materials and developed GitHub Actions and tools that are now available for the wider Cardano community to use.

## Our project aims and how we addressed them

We had set out with the following KPIs:

Automate: Develop and document GitHub Actions Educate: Host presentations and workshops on open source training Communicate: Embed course materials on the Catalyst School Website and market new GitHub Actions and Open Source Training on social media. We were successful in creating GitHub Actions and documentation, and in producing training materials. We also managed to develop two Dework-related tools, adapted to the needs of the Catalyst community. Unfortunately, due to financial constraints, we couldn't host as many workshops as planned or collaborate with Catalyst School on embedding course materials. However, we worked diligently to disseminate the materials and the tools developed.

## Key achievements (in particular around collaboration and engagement)&#x20;

Despite the markets and subsequent financial constraints, our team managed to:

Develop a GitHub action that automates weekly agendas for meetings. Develop a GitHub action that adds labels to newly created issues on GitHub Adapt to the needs of the community by broadening the scope of automation beyond GitHub Actions. Develop two Dework-related tools: Dework Monthly Performance Dashboard and Dework csv Exporter Create documentation for all these developed automations and tools Create documentation on Forking a repo, deploying your code, how to get your Dework Workspace id as well as your Discord Auth token. Restructure and organise the GitBook to be more readable.

## Key learnings

This project was a valuable lesson in resilience and adaptability. The ability to pivot our focus in response to changing market conditions and community needs was crucial. This experience has shown us the importance of managing your budget for unexpected circumstances.

## Next steps

We aim to continue developing and refining the automations and training materials based on community feedback and needs. We will also explore opportunities to find new channels for disseminating our materials and tools. We believe there's a great potential for these resources to contribute to the ongoing development and success of open source projects in the Catalyst community and to onboard anyone interested in software development.

## Final thoughts

We are proud of what we've achieved under challenging circumstances. We believe that the tools and resources we've developed can make a meaningful contribution to the Cardano ecosystem and we are excited about the potential for future development and collaboration.
