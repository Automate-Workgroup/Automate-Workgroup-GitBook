### Please provide an explanation of the evidence you are submitting - what does the evidence show? how does it demonstrate your month on month progress? \*

There is a link to the GitBook we have been working on and refining in the last month. There are also 2 links to repos for the Dework Dashboard where we have made updates in the last month. This dashboard is an experiment and can hopefully assist with monthly reporting for projects. It will show information like how many tasks were done this month, the current status of the project board etc.

### Finally, please list here what work you need to complete in the next 30 days in order to keep the project on track  \*

The dashboard will be deployed next month and work will be started on one last automation.
