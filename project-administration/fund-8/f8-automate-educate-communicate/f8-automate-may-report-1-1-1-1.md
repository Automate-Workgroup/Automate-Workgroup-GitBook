### Please provide details here about the work, tasks, activities you have delivered since last report. The more detail the better - one line is not sufficient \*

We continued testing the new automated Agenda on our project board and so far there hasn't been any errors or bugs. We had to transfer and update our Gitbook with all the changes we made to the project to prepare for work we will do on possible Fund 9 proposals. We created an automation that automatically labels a newly created Issue on the project board with ADA Due. So essentially we will only add items on the project board if they are payable tasks. We started documentation in our Gitbook on these newly created automations.

### Is there anything you would like to communicate to the Funded Proposer of Toolmakers Catalyst Circle reps to discuss in their forum? For example articulating ideas or recommendations for improvements to the Catalyst ecosystem?

Not at this time
