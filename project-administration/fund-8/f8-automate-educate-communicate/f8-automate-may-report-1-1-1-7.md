We continued development on the Dework Dashboard. We had meetings and discussed the potential directions for this dashboard. The admin side of this dashboard is pretty much finished and the public facing side is about halfway done. The admin side deals with capturing, sorting and sending the data to the database. It is also capable of handling multiple projects from multiple groups. The public facing dashboard is already getting the data. All that needs to be done now is mutating that data into valuable information and displaying it. We also tried integrate Chat-GPT into this dashboard, but then dicovered there was no free version for this.

### Is there anything you would like to communicate to the Funded Proposer of Toolmakers Catalyst Circle reps to discuss in their forum? For example articulating ideas or recommendations for improvements to the Catalyst ecosystem?

Not at this moment

### Do you wish to provide your evidence by way of a URL/ link(s) or do you wish to upload your evidence? \*

### Please provide an explanation of the evidence you are submitting - what does the evidence show? how does it demonstrate your month on month progress? \*

You can see the updates made to these 2 repos on a weekly basis. Discord authentication was added to the Admin side as well as functions to sort the data before sending it to the database. The functions to call the data was added to the dashboard side. No updates were made last week due to major updates needed in another project.

### Finally, please list here what work you need to complete in the next 30 days in order to keep the project on track  \*

Making final design decisions on the public facing dashboard and then building it. When this Dashboard is finished, we'll explore one last automation to finish of this project.
