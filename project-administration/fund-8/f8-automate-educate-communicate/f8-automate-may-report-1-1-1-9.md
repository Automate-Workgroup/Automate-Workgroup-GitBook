Still working on the final Automation. It involves a lot of moving parts and it has also changed quite a bit. Discovered Dework has a working API and created an automation that auto updates our database and started work on presenting the data and UI. Busy doing last few experiments that involves performance.

### Please provide an explanation of the evidence you are submitting - what does the evidence show? how does it demonstrate your month on month progress? \*

These 2 links hold the history of all the git commits I made to the code in these 2 repos. I created serverless functions that auto update the database so the the dashboard can get access to already processed data for better performance.

### Finally, please list here what work you need to complete in the next 30 days in order to keep the project on track  \*

I need to find the best way to present the data. It also has to be efficient at updating and automated as much as possible. Essentially the user just needs to view the dashboard and get the info they need, without worrying if the data is outdated. I will finish last few experiments on performance and decide how the data will be processed and presented. Once that is decided I will finish automation and create documentation.
