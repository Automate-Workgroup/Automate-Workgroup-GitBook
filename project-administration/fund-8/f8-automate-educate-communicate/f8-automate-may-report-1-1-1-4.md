### Please provide details here about the work, tasks, activities you have delivered since last report. The more detail the better - one line is not sufficient \*

We are involved in a few projects and all of them have different approaches when it comes to project management. We are continuesly looking at these different approaches and trying to identify possible automations. We noticed a lot of groups using dework and trying to identify a way to integrate GitHub with Dework and the processes involved to make the automations on GitHub's side effective. Dework has some issues feeding information to GitHub so we need to create a process that feeds from GitHub to Dework.

Not at this moment
