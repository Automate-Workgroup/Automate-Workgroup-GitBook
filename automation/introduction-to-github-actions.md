# Introduction to GitHub Actions

### 1. Introduction

We will be covering the bare minimum to get you started. For a more in depth look at how GitHub actions work, have a look [here.](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) We will be using GitHub actions that are available on the [Marketplace.](https://github.com/marketplace?category=\&query=\&type=actions\&verification=) This marketplace will be your go to when you need to automate something.&#x20;

GitHub actions consists of 2 parts. Part 1 is written in JavaScript, we will not be editing this and this works in the background. Part 2 is the part written in Yaml. The Yaml is where we will be doing our editing.&#x20;

GitHub actions gets triggered by specific events. There are more than 90 events that can trigger a GitHub action. It is also possible to let more than one event trigger your GitHub action.
