## Overview

Catalyst Training and Automation seeks automations that helps with project management. Some of these automations can be build with GitHub actions. If someone in the community has an action that falls within this scope or is on the "wish list" (Still need to make wish list public) then they can create documentation on how to implement the GitHub action and get incentivized by Catalyst Training and Automation.&#x20;

## Automation Actions

How to create a page for a GitHub action that is chargeable

Look at the already documented GitHub Actions. Follow the same pattern. Take screenshots and write descriptions. Also share the complete code. Place all this content in a Google Doc or PDF and send it to Catalyst Training and Automation (Contact details). They will approve and update the Gitbook accordingly.

## Documentation

What you need to document for a GitHub action that is chargeable

Start from the top of the yml file and work your way down. Explain the order of the jobs and how they will execute. Indicate small snippets of code as you explain every step. Provide links to other resources where applicable. Explain which variables or values can be changed and which are important to keep the same. At the end of the documentation provide the whole yml file's code as an example. Also include links of where you have used this GitHub action.&#x20;

## Charging
