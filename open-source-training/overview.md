# Overview

QADAO and Treasury Guild are working together to produce and refine training materials for open source project management and automation.&#x20;

We were funded in Catalyst Fund 8 - [Automate, Educate, Communicate](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398131) to merge and further develop previous materials developed for [F6 Open Source Training](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/368678) and [F6 Distributed Auditability](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/366707).
