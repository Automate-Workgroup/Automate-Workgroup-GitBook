How the management of wallets relates to project management ?

Who is doing what and being paid for what ?

Ideally Treasury Guild should be the owner of the wallet, but since these projects have already provided IOG with wallet addresses the team would have to share the recovery phrases with Treasury Guild. We will manage the wallets and execution of transactions. Transactions made will carry metadata with them to help identify exactly what the transaction was for.
