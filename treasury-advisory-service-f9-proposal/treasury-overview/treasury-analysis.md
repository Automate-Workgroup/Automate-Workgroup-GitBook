# Treasury analysis

**Treasury analysis**

(Andre, Miro)

### Treasury Project Plan

Most projects on Catalyst evolve as they execute their deliverables. As these changes happen we also need to _adapt and update the treasury project plan_.

### Monthly reports / Dashboard

Monthly reports will be generated and presented to the project team to open up any changes to the original plan and agree on the updated plan.

{% hint style="info" %}
M\_onthly reports - dashboard\_
{% endhint %}

Any updates to the monthly payments will be decided based on the monthly report.

### Upcoming payments

We will then prepare the information for the upcoming payments in spreadsheets and on the day IOG releases the funds we will make all the agreed upon payments.
