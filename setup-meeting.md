# Setup Meeting

**The Setup Meeting**

(Andre, Miro, Stephen, Felix)

Prior to the setup meeting we will send out preparatory advice in an email.&#x20;

The setup meeting will determine :

**Responsibilities** - To identify who is responsible for what. That is, the person(s) responsible for the funded project. This is to clearly identify the project team to workshop or to meet with.&#x20;

**Deliverables** - Deliverables will be identified and broken down into separate budget lines.&#x20;

**Commitments** - Commitments will be established and assigned to project participants. So it is clear who is doing what and who should be paid for what tasks.

**Fixed Costs** - Fixed Costs will be identified so that a schedule of regular payments may be drafted (incl. subscriptions etc).

This initial meeting will take about an hour. It will provide an informal introduction and ideation. And it will decide whether we move forward together.
