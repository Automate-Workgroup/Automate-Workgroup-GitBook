# Circle KPIs

## Overview

This GitHub action tracks the status of issues on a Project Board. It produces and updates the necessary files in your gh\_pages branch to create a dashboard that can be customized in the yml file as well as the css file if you want to change the style of the dashboard. The documentation on this GitHub action can be found [here](https://ethomson.github.io/issue-dashboard/documentation/) if you want to dig a little deeper. You'll find that this dashboard is very customizable.

Be sure to ad workflow dispatch so you can test your action. For this action you would also most likely set up a cron schedule. There are four actions happening here. First your repo gets checked, second the gh\_pages branch gets checked and a working directory gets set, third the dashboard gets generated and fourth the dashboard gets published. After checking out your repo the action looks for a branch called "gh\_pages". If it doesn't exist be sure to create it. Files in the gh\_pages branch get published to github pages by default. This GitHub action produces and updates the necessary files in this branch every time it runs.

Next up is generating the dashboard.  There are 2 parts here. The config and the widgets. In the config section you can set up variables as well as a function that you can use later in the action. Our first widget on this dashboard is a number widget. It starts with a title, description and then the type of widget. Each widget has its own "key value" pairs that you can change to display the data you want. The issue\_query field is used to pull the data from the issues in the repo. In the issue\_query field after the "repo:" you basically enter your organization or profile name and then after the "/" the name of the repo. After that you will notice "is:issue" and "created:>\{{ date("-30 days") \}}" This is to pull all issues that were created in the last 30 days. For more info on GitHub queries go to this [link](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests). There are quite a few queries you can use in this field to find the data you are looking for.
