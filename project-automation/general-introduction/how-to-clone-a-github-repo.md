## Overview

Cloning a GitHub repo is fairly easy.&#x20;

## Step 1 - Install GitHub for Desktop

You can find the installation download here

## Step 2 - Install Visual Studio Code

You can find installation download here

{% embed url="https://code.visualstudio.com" %}

## Step 3 - Open with GitHub Desktop

Go to the GitHub repo you would like to clone and click on the green button that says "<> Code". Next click on "Open with GitHub Desktop" and then click on the clone button in GitHub Desktop.

## Step 4 - Open with VS Code (Still in GitHub Desktop)

After you cloned the repo, click on the "Open in Visual Studio Code" button.

It should then open VS code and you can start editing the code.

## Final Thoughts

Please note that you would want to clone your own repo, so that when you push commits in VScode it sends it to your own repo and not to someone else's repo. Unless you are contributing to someone else's project.
