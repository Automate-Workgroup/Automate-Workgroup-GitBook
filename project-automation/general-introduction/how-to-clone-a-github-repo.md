## Overview

Forking a GitHub repo is fairly easy.&#x20;

## Step 1 - Install GitHub for Desktop

You can find the installation download here

## Step 2 - Install Visual Studio Code

You can find installation download here

{% embed url="https://code.visualstudio.com" %}

## Step 3 - Open with GitHub Desktop

1. Open the GitHub repository page that you want to fork
2. Click on the "Fork" button located at the top-right corner of the repository page. This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.
3. Once the forking process is complete, you will be redirected to your own copy of the repository.
4. Click on the "Code" button, which is located near the top-right corner of the repository page.&#x20;
5. Next click on "Open with GitHub Desktop" and then click on the clone button in GitHub Desktop.

## Step 4 - Open with VS Code (Still in GitHub Desktop)

After you cloned the repo, click on the "Open in Visual Studio Code" button.

It should then open VS code and you can start editing the code.

## Final Thoughts

For the Vue projects in the Automations section in this GitBook to work, you would need to create and update your .env file in the code. You can see how to do that in the llink below.
