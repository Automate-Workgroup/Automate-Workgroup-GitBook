# General Introduction

{% hint style="info" %}
Project Automation is led by Andr√© Diamond and includes various automations for redundant tasks in project management.
{% endhint %}

The goal of Project Automation is to look at how different projects are managed and identifying tasks that can be automated. These automations are somewhat tied to the platform that is used to manage the project. For example if the project is managed on GitHub, the automations are most likely created with GitHub Actions. Some of the automations are webpages built with javaScript and can be cloned by anyone to use for their own projects. Every automation comes with a repo and documentation. All automations are open source.\
\
Please note this GitBook is a working GitBook and some resources are still a work in progress. You can identify the automations that are complete and working by looking out for these Author Tabs at the top of the documentation page
