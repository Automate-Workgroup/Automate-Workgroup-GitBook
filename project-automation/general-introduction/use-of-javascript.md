# Use of Javascript

We had to use JavaScript to build some of these automations, as the projects were managed on platforms that didnt have the scope to build automations natively.\
\
We made use of the Vue.js framework and Vanilla JavaScript (Clientside JavaScript) to build some of these automations. We also made use of Supabase.js for database management.\
\
The reason we used clientside JavaScript in some cases was to make it super easy for someone with little to no coding experience to copy a repo and setting up the automation for themselves.\
\
The use of Vue.js was for building more complex automations and experimenting with dework exports to assist with monthly reporting on projects. Cloning these automations requires a little coding experience and is a great way to start your coding journey if you are looking to build something with JavaScript.
