# Use of Javascript

We had to use JavaScript to build some of these automations, as the projects were managed on platforms that didnt have the scope to build automations natively.\
\
We made use of the Vue.js framework to build some of these automations. \
\
We made it super easy for someone with little to no coding experience to copy a repo and set up the automation for themselves. You can view documentation here.

[how-to-fork-a-github-repo.md](how-to-fork-a-github-repo.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

The use of Vue.js was for building more complex automations and experimenting with dework exports to assist with monthly reporting on projects. Cloning these automations requires very little coding experience and is a great way to start your coding journey if you are looking to build something with JavaScript.
