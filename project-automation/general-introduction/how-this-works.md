## Overview

We are developing integrated

* PM Automation - project boards, tasks, commitments, deliverables
* Reporting - how Project Management Automation fits into monthly reporting
* Education - how to describe all the above as a service --> Clients

We have compiled a list of automations along with documentation on their implementation, which can be beneficial for projects managed on GitHub, Dework, and in some cases, for projects managed on other platforms as well.
