## Overview

We are developing integrated

* PM Automation - project boards, tasks, commitments, deliverables
* Reporting - how Project Management Automation fits into monthly reporting
* Education - how to describe all the above as a service --> Clients

We created a list of automations together with documentation on how to implement them. These automations can be useful for projects that are managed on GitHub, Dework and in some cases the automations are agnostic of where the project is being managed.
