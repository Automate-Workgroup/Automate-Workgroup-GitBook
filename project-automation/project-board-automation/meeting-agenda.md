# Meeting Agenda Action

## Overview

This GitHub action looks for an open issue with the label "Meeting". It copies the body of the issue and closes the issue. It then creates a new issue with the same body as the old issue, but with an updated title. It uses Cron to have the issues ready for scheduled dates.
