# Meeting Agenda Action

## Overview

This GitHub action looks for an open issue with the label "Meeting". It copies the body of the issue and closes the issue. It then creates a new issue with the same body as the old issue, but with an updated date and title. It uses Cron to have the issues ready for scheduled dates. This is useful for having an issue on your project board that serves as an agenda for meetings. This particular action is built to update the agenda twice a week.&#x20;

It uses the same marketplace GitHub Action found in the Town Hall Slides action, along side another action to find an issue with a certain label. We also do an API call, some text formatting and make use of environment variables in this action.

### 1.  Schedule

We use workflow\_dispatch to manually run our action for testing purposes while building the action. Once we are happy with the results we set the cron value to run our action on specific dates.

### 2. Env Variables

Next up we set the env variables. Enter the names of the org and repo where the project board lives that holds the issue. Enter the label of the issue you want to update. Its best to have a unique label for this one issue to avoid updating other issues.

### 3.  Find the issue

The first step will look for an open issue with the label you provided for the env variable. Take note that you should have only one open issue with this label on the project board. The "state" key refers to the state of the issue (open or closed). And the "labels" key refers to the label of the issue. Note the format we use when referring to env variables - "$\{{ env.Labels \}}" Its basically env. followed by the key we used when setting the variables. (Refer to step above) When this step completes we can get the issue number from it at a later stage by calling the result.

### 4. Doing an API call and setting result to env variable

Next up we get the issue number of the issue found in the step that looked for the open issue with the label. We call this result like so - $\{{ steps.last-issue.outputs.issue-number \}}

We then use this issue number in an API call. This API call looks for an issue in a repo. Note how we use the org and repo env variables in the url as well.&#x20;

The ".body" refers to the key in the returned Json, that you need the value of. If you wanted the title of this issue you would replace .body with .title .We then take the result and turn it into yet another env variable called iBody. Note that this is another way of setting env variables.

Also note how we get values from other steps by using   steps - id - outputs - name.&#x20;

Like so - $\{{ steps.propdata.outputs.data \}}  . The id in this case was propdata and the name was data. You'll see when we do the API call we set the name to data in the beginning of the line right after echo.
