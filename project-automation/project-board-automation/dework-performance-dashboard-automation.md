## Overview

The following tool was built with Vue.js . It makes use of Dework's API to get all task information from a specific workspace. This workspace id can be changed in the code and will be explained in this documentation. Once the task information is accessed it gets curated and processed to prepare it for charts and a chatGPT prompt. The dashboard has 4 charts and a button to create a chatGPT promt. If you click the button the prompt gets copied into your clipboard and you can then just paste it in chatGPT. There are 2 other stats... Total tasks done and documentation made. We will explore in the documentation how to change these stats.&#x20;
